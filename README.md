Drupal 8 Training Materials
I was the lead trainer for Drupal MidCamp Chicago 2017. 
I wanted to provde MdCamp attendiees with a Drupal 8 resource that they could download and use to lean Drupal. 
We ended up covering a lot of the material in class. 
This is a live document, and I will keep adding to it and eventually use it for my IT320 class at DePaul University.
